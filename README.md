This repository is my attempt at practicing bash scripting through building five programs, namely; 
1. questionnaire.sh - that asked quastions, got feedback/input form user and printed output
2. countdown.sh - that counted down from the number provided while executing the program
3. bingo.sh - that generated random numbers and from the output through the use of if statements, assigned specific number groups to a certain letter
4. fortune.sh - one that took input from the user and genearated output randomly froma set of provided options
5. five.sh - one that ran all the other programs at once
Concepts covered:
  - file creation
  - changing mods from reader to viewwer
  - variable creation
  - getting user input
  - printing variables + the user input
  - scripting
  - conditional operations: if
  - loops: for loops, while loops, until
  - function creation and calling
